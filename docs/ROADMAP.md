# üõ£Ô∏è ROADMAP

* Easy Scheme
* Awasome Scheme
* Usefull Scheme
* Esoteric Scheme

## Scheme implementation
* [husk\scheme](https://github.com/helvm/husk-scheme) - life version
* [Write You A Scheme, Version 2](https://github.com/helvm/scheme) - best version
* [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://github.com/helvm/scheme48) - first version
* [Wiz - A Scheme interpreter implemented in Haskell](https://github.com/helvm/wiz) - a toy Scheme interpreter in Haskell.
* [Lisper](https://github.com/helvm/lisper) - a tiny scheme interpreter in Haskell
* https://norvig.com/lispy.html


## Awasome Scheme - UnShceme
* [untyped](https://github.com/helvm/untyped)/[tapl](https://github.com/helvm/haskell-tapl) - An implementation of untyped lambda calculus in Haskell
* unlambda 

## Usefule Scheme - register machine 

* SICP - register machine
* [lisp-llvm-compiler](https://github.com/helvm/lisp-llvm-compiler) - only `add` and `sub`
* subleq
* PreScheme
* AsmScheme

## Esoteric Scheme - stack machine - Joy implementation
* Dupe
* [Sponge](http://cubonegro.orgfree.com/sponge/sponge.html) - a quick and dirty compiler for a tiny subset of Scheme into Befunge 98. The compiler is written in (hopefully ANSI) Common Lisp.

* [silly-joy](https://github.com/helvm/silly-joy) is an interpreter for the concatenative programming language Joy, implemented in Haskell using extensible-effects.
* [The Joy programming language](https://github.com/helvm/joy-owainlewis)
* [The Joy programming language](https://github.com/helvm/joy-amar47shah)
* [Interpreter for the concatenative language Joy](https://github.com/helvm/Joy-ClathomasPrime)
* [joy-free-monads](https://github.com/helvm/joy-free-monads)
* [Stackist: a stack-based programming language and runtime](https://github.com/helvm/stackist)


## Languages to implement
* [Carp](https://github.com/helvm/Carp) - A statically typed lisp, without a GC, for real-time applications.
